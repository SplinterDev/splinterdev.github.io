      <p>From 2010 to 2020, I was the drummer of the Brazilian gothic-death metal band <a href="https://www.instagram.com/finita.metal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finita</a>. In late 2019, I moved from Santa Maria, where the band is based, so we had to part ways. I still take part in some recordings and you might see me in a picture or a video from time to time.</p>
      <p>You can find them on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2wbIsjB3vYzkOCwqbLReTg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> and, in early 2021, they released new videos from 2020's Metal Sul Festival on their YouTube Channel, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQWzuvLqEUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holocaust</a>. Check it out!</p>
