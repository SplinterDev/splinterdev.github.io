# Intro

This is not a blog. Google defines a blog as:

> a regularly updated website or web page, typically one run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style.

And, by this definition, yeah, sure, this is a blog. But everybody knows a blog is not simply a regularly updated web page written in a conversational style. Nowadays there are niche blogs, news blogs, and business blogs. There are personal blogs, sure, but any of those can become a business, or they can be a means for bringing customers to a business. And this, my friends, this that you're reading, is not any of that at all. It probably won't even be regularly updated.

So what is this? Well, the name on the left-side menu says **logbook**, so this is what it is. Here's how Google defines logbook:

> an official record of events during the voyage of a ship or aircraft.

Yeah. This is definitely a logbook. This is the official record of the events that are taking place in the voyage that is my life. I'm the ship, therefore. My mind is. And it's traveling through the vast seas of the unknown, trying to uncover the mysteries of what lies beyond the dense fog that hides the future, the unreachable future. When we reach it, it becomes the present -- only for an instant --- and then it's the past. And we look forward again, to the future, and we see nothing but the fog. A thick wall of nothingness, the unknowable. And we hear the sounds of what lies on the other side, and we imagine what's there. And we fail to interpret any of the sounds.

Where will you be in five years? I don't know. Will you be writing a **"** logbook **"** ? Doubtful. But this is not about the destination at all. This is a motherfucking logbook, and a logbook keeps track of the events of the voyage, god damn it! It's the journey. The journey will inevitably take us to the destination, yes. But then, the destination becomes one of the stops -- only for an instant -- and then it's the past. Part of the journey. And a new destination will be hiding in the fog. And in the instant when the future becomes the present, when we finally uncover what this new destination is, you'll read all about it in the fucking logbook.

Peace.
