# Card

The idea of the `card` branch is to create an app that shows my profile like a business card. At its simplest it should be a component that should my basic information on one side and allow the user to flip it to see the other side. From there, I can create more and more complex things to create cool user interactions.

## Requirements

### Must Have

- Flippable card with different contents on each side

### Could Have

- Refresh the other side of the card before flipping so that we can render infinite components
- Flip on different directions

### Won't Have
